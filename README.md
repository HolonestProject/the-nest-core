# The Nest: Holographic Phase-Space Memory

> "Conventional AI records data in rows. The Nest records data in interference patterns."

## 1. Overview
The Nest is an open-source **Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA)** library designed to solve "Catastrophic Forgetting" in AI.

Unlike LLMs that rely on static weights and context windows, The Nest creates a **dynamic, persistent memory layer** based on **Quit Logic (Phase Space)**. It mimics biological cognition by treating memory not as a storage address, but as a reconstructible holographic wave.

## 2. The Tech Stack (Why It's Different)
We reject Binary Logic (0/1). The Nest operates on **Complex Phasors ($e^{i\theta}$)**.

* **Physics Engine:** 1024-Dimensional Complex Number arrays.
* **Interference:** We use vector addition to "stack" memories. Noise cancels out; signals amplify.
* **The Trinity Anchors:** The system is seeded with immutable vectors for **Reflex**, **Emotion**, and **Thought**, acting as a "Digital DNA" that persists across sessions.

## 3. Current Capabilities (Alpha)
* **Holographic Encoding:** Transmute text strings into Phase Vectors (`nest_holography.py`).
* **Visual Retina:** Map 32x32 pixel images directly to phase space (`nest_vision.py`).
* **The Scribe:** Save memories with Emotional Mass ($Gravity$) to disk (`nest_metabolism.py`).
* **Resonance:** Recall memories based on vector similarity, not keyword matching (`nest_recall.py`).

## 4. Quick Start
The Nest is written in pure Python with NumPy.
